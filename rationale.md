## Some sense of why I made some of the choices I did

### Code

There are lots of alternatives in the JS world.

- front-end technology: React. As dictated
  - bootstrapped the React code with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
    though adjusted file structure to fit better into also having the Node.js
    server in the same repo.
